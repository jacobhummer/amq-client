h2. About amq-client

This project is **no longer actively developed**.

It used to back "amqp gem":http://rubyamqp.info All the relevant functionality has
now been merged into amqp gem. This library should only be used by projects that
have really good reasons to do so.

If you are looking for a good Ruby RabbitMQ client, consider "Bunny":http://rubybunny.info
or "HotBunnies":http://hotbunnies.info.
